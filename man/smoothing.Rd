\arguments{
\item{x}{input time-series.}

\item{methods}{list of methods to use.}

\item{endpoints}{Method used for the asymmetric filter.
By default the Musgrave method is used}

\item{length}{the length of the}

\item{icr}{I/C ratio used for the asymmetric filter.}

\item{asymmetric_var}{when \code{local_icr = TRUE},  if \code{asymmetric_var = TRUE} then the variance is estimated for each asymmetric filters instead of using the variance associated to the symmetric estimates.}

\item{degree}{if \code{local_icr = TRUE}, degree of polynomial used to estimate the local bias parameter.}

\item{ao}{Dates of the Additive Outliers (AO) which effects are associated to the irregular component.}

\item{ao_tc}{Dates of the Additive Outliers (AO) which effects are associated to the trend-cycle component.}

\item{ls}{Dates of the Level Shifts (LS) which effects are associated to the trend-cycle component.}

\item{...}{other unused parameters.}
